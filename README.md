## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or higher)
-   PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
-   Discord Bot Token
-   Discord Server with appropriate permissions

### Environment Variables

The following variables must be available in the host:

```env
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export GUILD_ID=your_guild_id
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/plazero_bot
# OR use individual variables:
export PGDATABASE=plazero_bot
export PGUSER=postgres
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Database Setup

The bot uses PostgreSQL with an automated migration system:

```bash
# Create database and run all migrations
npm run setup

# Check migration status
npm run migrate:status

# Run pending migrations
npm run migrate:up

# Rollback a migration
npm run migrate:rollback <version>
```

For detailed database setup instructions, see [Database Setup](src/migrations/DB_SETUP.md).

### Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Ensure environment variables are set**

    ```env
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
    CLIENT_ID=your_bot_client_id
    GUILD_ID=your_server_id
    ```

2. **Deploy using production script**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

**Note**: The bot uses ES modules and requires the compiled JavaScript files in the `dist/` directory. The `start` script automatically builds the project, registers commands, and starts the bot.
